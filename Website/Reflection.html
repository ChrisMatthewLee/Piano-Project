	<p>Overall, I feel that the project went very well. There were quite a few difficult obstacles, bugs, and screw ups that we had to get through. The hardest part to figure out was how to write the function that would properly play the .wav files from Audacity and also figuring out how to make the keys change colors for a certain amount of time. However, the part that took the longest was plotting the damn coordinates for the Tkinter GUI.</p>
