	<h1>Description</h1>
	<p>The concept of the Piano Project is pretty simple (coding it, however, was not). When you press a key on the keyboard, it's correspoding key on the piano changes colors and it plays the note sound associated with the piano key.</p>
	<p>This project was made using Python, the language that created the functions, Tkinter, a Python add-on that you can use to create a GUI, and Audacity, which provided the .wav files for the piano note sounds.</p>

	<h2>Piano GUI</h2>

	<p>This is just the piano without any keys being pressed.</p>
	
	<img src="Images/piano_white_key.PNG" />
	<p>This is the piano whenever a white key (F) is triggered by the keyboard key "f" being pressed. (Note: The sound is also playing while the keyboard key is pressed and the piano key is undergoing the color inversion) </p>
	
	<img src="Images/piano_black_key.PNG" />
	<p>This is the piano whenever a black key (D#) is triggered by the keyboard key "w" being pressed. (Note: The sound is also playing while the keyboard key is pressed and the piano key is undergoing the color inversion) </p>
